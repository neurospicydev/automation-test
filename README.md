# Git Workflow Automation

A bash script used to add files to git staging area, commit and push to a remote repository

## Description

This bash script simplifies git workflow by automating staging, committing, and pushing changes. It includes user-friendly prompts, and error handling to demonstrate knowledge and understanding in:  
- **Bash scripting**  
- **Git operations**  
- **User input validation**  
- **Error handling and automation**  

## Key Features  

- **Git Repository Validation**  
  - Ensures the script runs only in a valid git repo.  

- **Smart Staging**  
  - Skips `git add` if files are already staged, saving time and effort.  

- **Input Validation**  
  - Enforces non-empty commit messages and file arguments.  

- **Upstream Branch Check**  
  - Checks for upstream branch and sets up tracking if missing, ensuring smooth `git push` operations.
  - Auto-sets upstream branch on first push.  

- **Retry Logic**  
  - **Commit**: Loops until the user fixes issues (empty message, conflicts, etc.).  
  - **Push**: Retries automatically after transient errors (network issues), allowing quick recovery. 

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL).

## What to Test  

- **Edge Cases**  
  - Run the script outside a git repo.  
  - Provide no files during `git add`.  
  - Leave the commit message empty.  

- **Error Recovery**  
  - Simulate a failed `git push` (e.g., disconnect from the internet, then reconnect).  
  - Trigger a `git commit` failure (e.g., use a pre-commit hook that rejects the commit).  

- **Resume Functionality**  
  - Stage files, then rerun the script to skip `git add`.  
  - Create unpushed commits, then rerun to push them first.  

## Upcoming Features

- **Interactive Staging**: Choose to add or decline adding more files to the staging area.
- **Custom Upstream Branch Support**  
  - Allow users the option to specify a non-default upstream branch (e.g., `origin/dev`).  
- **Diff Preview Before Commit**  
  - Show `git diff --staged` output to let users review changes before committing.
